# Localized Primes

Complete the app so that the user can change their locale as well as iterate through every prime number. Take special care to only re-calculate the prime number when the user clicks NEXT PRIME.

## Tasks

- Increment the prime number count when the button is clicked.
- Change the language when the select option is changed.
- Memoize nth-prime so that it's only re-calculated when count changes.
