# Task manager reducer

Given the completed TaskManager component, your challenge is to finish implementing the reducer function so that the user can add, update, and delete tasks.

## Tasks

- The user should be able to add a new task
- The user should be able to update the status of a task (`completed` or `pending`)
- The user should be able to delete a task
