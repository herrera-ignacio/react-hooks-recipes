# Add to cart reducer

Given the final ShoppingCart component (including all the JSX and event handlers), your job is to finish implementing both the reducer function as well as the calculateTotal function.

calculateTotal takes in the cart and should return a single numeric value representing the total cost of all the items in the cart.

For the reducer, look at the component to figure out which action types are being dispatched as well as the shape of the action objects.

## Tasks

- Render the appropriate UI if there are no items in the cart
- Give the user the ability to add items to the shopping cart
- Give the user the ability to remove items from the shopping cart
- Appropriately update the quantity of items in the shopping cart
- Appropriately calculate the total cost of all items in the shopping cart
