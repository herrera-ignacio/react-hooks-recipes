# Tabs context

Given the completed JSX, finish the app so that the correct tab content is shown when a tab is clicked.

This challenge is deliberately vague. You'll need to carefully examine the final app as well as each component and what props it receives to figure out how to complete the challenge.

Once finished, you should have a working tabs implementation that is hyper flexible and not coupled at all to the current layout of the app.
