# News Feed Context

In this challenge you're given a news feed with different videos. To improve the UX of your feed, the challenge is to make sure only one video can play at a time.

Specifically you'll probably want to tackle the following steps.

1. Finish the NewsFeed component by rendering a VideoItem component for every video in the videos array.

2. Finish the VideoPlaybackProvider component so that playingVideoId and setPlayingVideoId are available throughout the component tree.

3. Finish VideoItem so that the user can play and pause a video, but that when they do, any other video that is currently playing is paused.
